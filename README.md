# Implementation-of-Library-using-AVL-Tree-Linked-list
Implementation of Library using AVL Tree &amp; Linked list to simulate some functionality of an Index.

# About the Project
In this Assignment you will have to simulate some functionality of an Index. It is assumed that a number
of users want to access a libraryâ€™s data. The Library has a collection of books. Each book has an ISSN,
title, list of author names, # of copies available as reference book and # of copies as issuable book. This
data is stored in a doubly linked list in sorted order according to the ISSN. However, we want to
implement an efficient system that can access and update this recode in much less time. So we will create
an index (AVL tree) for this data. For each book record we will have a node in the AVL tree. Each node
in the AVL tree will have the ISSN of the book and a pointer to the node of Linked list where other
attributes of that book is stored.

# Features
The users of this system can perform the following functions:

# How to Run
This project is built in Visual Studio in C++ language which is required in order to execute this project.
